# Problem Statement

Noise Pollution has been a serious topic of nationwide attention and discussion as in the previous months many outfits had alleged that the blaring loudspeakers of religious buildings had been a constant cause of disturbance in people's day-to-day life.
Hence, Supreme Court had given a verdict on religious buildings to maintain permissible decibel levels during prayers.
The noise levels near many hospitals — which are silence zones in major cities of the states have been found to be above the permissible limits during festive seasons and during the constant traffic hours. Such high Levels poses a threat to the elderly, heart and trauma patients.
Therefore, these cases present a huge scope in developing a device that could monitor noise levels in real-time and can trigger location co-ordinates in case of violation of decibel-levels.
